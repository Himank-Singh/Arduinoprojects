# Smart_Parking_System

This project is created by Rohan Kumar,Akshat Verma and Himank Singh members of team R.A.H.


It is difficult to find a parking slot in crowded places like in malls, theaters, clubs, etc. And due to this 
traffic occurs in that places. So smart parking system is introduced. This system is useful for crowded 
areas like mall. This system checks the free slots and guide the vehicle towards the slot. A vehicle 
counter counts the vehicles entering the parking and provides count of the free slots and full slots.
